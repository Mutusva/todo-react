## Tech used
React 16.13
Node.js 12.18
MongoDB Atlass

##Testing the APP
1) in the project folder run "npm i"
2) cd into src/api
3) run "node index.js" this runs the nodejs express API.
4) in the project directory run "yarn start" . this should open the browser on the landing page.

##Issues that could be addredd
1) finishing the edit operation, ran out of time due to deadlines on my side
2) ould have added some form of auth
3) adding some swagger documentation

##General comment
I wish I had more time to complete and perfect this app, just have some pressure this work. I wanted to show more.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
